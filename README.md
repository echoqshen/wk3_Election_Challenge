## Overview of Election Audit:
We went thru building an election audit results showing the winning candidate from the module. Now we are going to apply the same method to include additional data to complete the report.

## Election-Audit Results:
    * The total votes in this congressional election was 369,711.
    * Breakdown by county as following:

## Election-Audit Summary:
I decleared a result dictionary at the start, which includes 2 keys 'camdidate' and 'county', with dictionary as values pairing to the keys. This is a more flexiable way. It is easier to add json variables to.
